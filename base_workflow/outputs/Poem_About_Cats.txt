In the moon's gentle glow, they silently tread,
Whiskers twitching, with grace they spread.
From ancient temples to cozy hearth's light,
Cats weave their magic in the night.

With eyes like emeralds, sharp and bright,
Their gaze holds secrets of the night.
A dance of shadows, sleek and fair,
With elegance they glide through the air.

In playful leaps, with curious grace,
They explore the world, each hidden space.
Yet in their gaze, aloof and wise,
A mystery dances, deep in their eyes.

In every purr and gentle knead,
Comfort and warmth fulfill a need.
Their antics bring laughter, joy, and cheer,
A faithful friend, always near.

Symbols of luck, or myths of old,
In every culture, their stories told.
From Bastet's blessing in ancient lore,
To witches' companions, they explore.

With a gentle paw and a soft, warm purr,
They remind us of the bond we share.
Oh, timeless feline, in shadows you roam,
With you, our hearts find a home.
